Hi, I'm Charles. Welcome to my Github page. I am a software engineer and computer science teacher with Peanuts Education, a private art and science school in Tainan, Taiwan. My interests lie in the intersection of art, culture, and computer science. Science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) have been a driving force in my life for more than a decade. I'm open to any opportunity to develop or share my knowledge in these fields.
