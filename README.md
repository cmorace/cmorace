Hi, I'm Charles. Welcome to my Github page. I am a software engineer and computer science instructor at Peanuts, a private art and science school in Tainan, Taiwan. I am also the founder of Method Software, which develops multimedia software for businesses and government organizations based in Taiwan. 

Since my first trip to Taiwan in 2009, I have been fascinated by the intersection of art, culture, and computer science. I spent five years as a graduate research assistant and Ph.D. candidate at National Cheng Kung University, receiving formal training in computer graphics, machine learning, and mathematical optimization techniques. Previously I was an undergraduate at the University of Rhode Island, where I earned a bachelor's in computer science and mathematics. Science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) have been the focus of my life for more than a decade. I enjoy immensely any opportunity to develop or share my knowledge in these fields.
